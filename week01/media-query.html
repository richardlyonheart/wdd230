                1Nephi1:1
            </h2>
            <p>
                1 I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, 
                therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; 
                and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, 
                nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; 
                yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, 
                therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.
            </p>

                Ether 15:3
            </h2>
            <p>
                3 He began to repent of the evil which he had done; 
                he began to remember the words which had been spoken by the mouth of all the prophets, 
                and he saw them that they were fulfilled thus far, every whit; 
                and his soul mourned and refused to be comforted.
